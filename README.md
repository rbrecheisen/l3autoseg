# l3autoseg
Automatic segmentation of muscle and fat in L3 images

Purpose of this project is (1) to reproduce the CNN created by Leroy Volmer (MAASTRO)
using Keras instead of only TensorFlow and (2) use a standard CNN, like AlexNet, and
transfer learning to try and improve the resulting prediction model.
